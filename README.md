## About The Project

The point of this project was to create a Didlydoo App using different instructions!  
This app had to be an app similar to Trello which means an app to plan what u want.  
We worked in a group with two front and two back.  
We used Trello and worked with a db.  
I personally worked with JS, SASS and CSS.
